    <h3>Creating your first program</h3>
    <p>Open <a href="https://codewith.mu/" target="_blank">the Mu editor</a> on your computer. <strong>If there is code on the screen</strong>, start a New program from the menu.</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScienceOxford/cyber-pet/master/images/mu_toolbar_new.png" alt="Mu menu, highlighting 'New'" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <p>Type these two lines of code into your blank window:</p>
    <pre>from microbit import *
display.show(Image.HAPPY)</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Plug your micro:bit into the computer, then click Flash:</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScienceOxford/cyber-pet/master/images/mu_toolbar_flash.png" alt="Mu menu, highlighting 'Flash'" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <p>Some code should be running on your micro:bit!</p>
    <p><strong>If you get a message scrolling across the micro:bit's screen</strong>, this is an error message!</p>
    <p><strong>Debug</strong> your code, then click Flash again to test your changes.</p>
    <p>Once your code is working - change it!</p>
    <p>Instead of <code>HAPPY</code>, can you think of another <code>Image</code> the micro:bit could <code>show</code> on its <code>display</code>?

    <h3>How does the game work?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The micro:bit randomly chooses one of its options.</li>
      <li>It stores this choice in a <strong>list</strong>, so it can keep track of all of its choices.</li>
      <li>The player chooses from their options.</li>
      <li>The micro:bit stores the players choice in <strong>another list</strong>, so it can keep track of all their choices.</li>
      <li>When the player has chosen the same number of things as the micro:bit has, the two lists are compared.</li>
      <li>If the two lists are the same, the micro:bit knows that the player was correct!</li>
      <li>If the two lists are <strong>not</strong> the same, it knows that the player got it wrong.</li>

    <h3>Testing the game</h3>
    <p>The code below is a working game.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Copy and paste it into Mu.</li>
      <li>Flash it to your micro:bit <strong>without changing anything</strong>.</li>
      <li>Play the game - does it work how you would expect?</li>
      <li>Think about what improvements you could make to the game.</li>
      <li>Make some changes!</li>

    <h3>How does the game work?</h3>
    <p>The last section of the code is where all the good stuff happens - inside the main <strong>loop</strong>.</p>
  <img src=".\images\main-loop.PNG" alt="explanation of the main game loop" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <ol>
      <li>The micro:bit creates a random sequence</li>
      <li>The micro:bit lets the player respond</li>
      <li>If the player's response is the same as the micro:bit's sequence...</li>
      <li>The micro:bit knows the player has done it correctly.</li>
      <li>If the player's reponse is <strong>not</strong> the same as the micro:bit's sequence...</li>
      <li>The micro:bit knows the player has done it incorrectly</li>
      <li>The micro:bit pauses for a second...</li>
      <li>Then starts again, and takes another action!</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>The things that happen when the micro:bit takes a turn, and how it understands inputs from the player, are defined by the <strong>functions</strong> further up the code.</p>
    <p>Each important section is labelled with a comment, like this:</p>

    <h3>What next?</h3>
    <p>When deciding what to add to, or change, in the code, think careful about where your changes need to happen.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you changing the micro:bit's action?</li>
      <li>Are you changing what the player has to do?</li>
      <li>Do you need to change both of these things to make the game work?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The links below give you some ideas and help to improve your game.</p>
    <p>Use the print-outs of the code around the room to help you - <strong>think about where your changes need to happen</strong>!</p>
